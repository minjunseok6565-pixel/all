"""Mappings from training categories to SSOT rating keys.

We keep this mapping deliberately simple for the first iteration:
  - It provides enough control for training focus.
  - It aligns with `derived_formulas.COL` (2K-style base keys).

Later, you can refine this into more granular focuses (e.g. 3PT vs Mid vs Rim
finishing) without changing DB schema (plans are JSON).
