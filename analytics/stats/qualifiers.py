"""Eligibility rules (qualifiers) for leaderboards.

Leaderboards without qualifiers look unstable and untrustworthy in a season sim
(1-game samples can dominate). This module computes *season-relative*
minimum requirements so rules scale naturally for shortened seasons,
partial seasons, and playoffs.

Rules are intentionally:
- deterministic
- simple (easy to reason about)
- defensive to missing data

If you want to mimic NBA official thresholds exactly, you can implement a
separate profile. The default approach here is dynamic and game-friendly.
