"""Tuning parameters for the between-game readiness subsystem.

This module is the single place to tune readiness behavior.

Sharpness (player)
------------------
- Stored in 0..100.
- Decays with inactivity (time since last update).
- Gains from game minutes, with diminishing returns as sharpness approaches 100.

Scheme familiarity (team)
-------------------------
- Stored in 0..100 per (team, season, scheme).
- Decays toward a floor value with time when not used.
- Gains when the scheme is used in a game, with diminishing returns.

Engine coupling
---------------
- Sharpness and (optionally) familiarity can be converted into attribute deltas
  (attrs_mods_by_pid) via readiness.service.
- Familiarity can also be converted into multipliers for matchengine tactics knobs.

All timestamps must be in *in-game* ISO format; never use the host OS clock.
