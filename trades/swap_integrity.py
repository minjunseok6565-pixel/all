"""Shared swap-right validation helpers.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Historically, swap validation logic lived in two places:
  - trades.rules.builtin.ownership_rule (validator stage)
  - league_service.LeagueService.execute_trade (execution stage)

This duplication risks "validator passes, execute fails" mismatches as the
code evolves. This module centralizes the core swap integrity checks so both
stages stay consistent.

Scope
-----
We validate that:
  - Both referenced picks exist.
  - The picks match on (year, round).
  - swap_id is canonical for the pick pair.
  - If a swap_right record exists for swap_id, it matches the pick pair (and
    optionally its stored year/round matches the picks).
  - Ownership rules are enforced consistently:
      * existing right: from_team must own the right
      * new right: from_team must own at least one of the picks (creation gate)

Notes
-----
We intentionally do NOT enforce swap_right.active here to preserve current
behavior (inactive rights are handled at settlement time). If you want to
disallow trading inactive rights later, add a separate rule and call it from
both validator+execute.
