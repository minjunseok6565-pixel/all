"""Rule-only player metadata builder (SSOT-backed).

This module builds a minimal ``players`` dictionary suitable for trade rule evaluation.

Design constraints:
- Values returned here are derived from SQLite SSOT (``LeagueRepo``).
- Never read from UI caches (e.g., ``state['ui_cache']``).
- Keep schema minimal and rule-focused; do not include UI-only fields.

Phase 2 implementation notes:
- Only computes metadata for the provided ``player_ids`` (deal-scoped).
- Uses transactions_log (SSOT) to compute:
    * last_contract_action_type/date
    * signed_via_free_agency
    * acquired_via_trade / acquired_date (based on trade player_moves -> to_team)
    * trade_return_bans for the provided season_year
- Falls back to contracts.signed_date for signed_date when needed.

Known limitation / unresolved (by design, noted for future optimization):
- transactions_log has no player_id column; repo filters by player_ids by parsing payload_json in Python.
- Legacy trade payloads without player_moves are partially supported for return bans via assets_summary,
  but acquisition (to_team) cannot be reliably computed. We fail-fast when that ambiguity would matter.
