"""Stepien rule policy.

This module centralizes Stepien logic so that validation rules and
generation/AI systems can share identical behavior.

Policy mirrors the behavior currently implemented in `PickRulesRule`:

- Stepien is evaluated over consecutive (year, year+1) pairs.
- The evaluation window is:
    start = current_draft_year + 1
    end   = current_draft_year + lookahead
  and `end` is clamped so that (year+1) remains within the range of years
  actually represented by the first-round pick data (to avoid false
  violations when pick data is incomplete).
- A violation occurs if, for any checked year, the team owns *zero* first-
  round picks in both `year` and `year+1` after applying ownership changes.
